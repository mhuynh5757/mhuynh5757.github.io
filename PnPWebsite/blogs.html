										In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen makes many pokes at the ideal marriage. Austen, however, does not completely disagree with her society's values. Because of this, she only makes small pokes at marriage. To analyze the qualities she looks for in a marriage, we must first isolate the marriages that she specifies with detail.<br/>There are seven important marriages that she points out:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Jane and Bingley</li>
										<li>Elizabeth and Darcy</li>
										<li>Mrs. and Mr. Hurst</li>
										<li>Collins and Lucas</li>
										<li>Wickham and Lydia</li>
										<li>Mr. and Mrs. Bennet</li>
										<li>Mr. and Mrs. Gardner</li>
									</ul>
									We can further refine this list into two categories, “successful” and “unsuccessful.”<br/>Successful:
									<ul>
										<li>Jane and Bingley</li>
										<li>Elizabeth and Darcy</li>
										<li>Collins and Lucas</li>
										<li>Mr. and Mrs. Gardner</li>
									</ul>
									Unsuccessful:
									<ul>
										<li>Mrs. and Mr. Hurst</li>
										<li>Wickham and Lydia</li>
										<li>Mr. and Mrs. Bennet</li>
									</ul>
									<p class="text-indent">
										Right off the bat, we can see that the successful marriages have a lot of major themes in common. With all the marriages, both parties have their desires fulfilled. With “Jane and Bingley” and “Elizabeth and Darcy,” they found the person with the personalities they seek. Jane and Bingley are both kind and even naive, but they are kind together. Mr. Bennet even jokingly notes that Jane and Bingley might even go poor from donating so much of their money. In Elizabeth and Darcy’s relationship, they both find their intellectual equals, and know that because they love each other intellectually that they are truly in love. Elizabeth is receiving financially stability from Darcy’s fortune, but it was not her primary reason for marriage. This is also prevalent on Darcy’s side, where he tries so hard to be uncongenial as to prevent women marrying him just for his money. With Collins and Lucas, they both viewed marriage in a more business-like manner. Collins needs a wife to stay employed by Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Lucas needs a husband for financial stability. Because they are both not necessarily malicious, they enjoy the marriage as a business and it works out for both of them. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner’s marriage is probably the least elaborated of the successful marriages, but it is obvious that it works out for the two. Mr. and Mrs. Gardner both love each other and it is rarely seen that they argue. They are situated well financially, but it is unclear if they marry just for the money. It is improbable that the case is so, as they work together well enough.
									</p>
									<p class="text-indent">
										The unsuccessful marriages also have a lot in common. In Mr. and Mrs. Hurst marriage, one side of the relationship gains almost nothing other than money. Mrs. Hurst is completely ignored by her husband, who seems like he is always drunk or passed out from being too drunk. Their relationship does not work as well as Collins and Lucas despite both marriages being made in the interest of business. This is because Mr. Hurst is always drunk, Mr. Collins does not have the same irredeemable quality. Mr. Collins has the capability to care about his wife, where Mr. Hurst does not seem to. Wickham and Lydia's marriage is perhaps the most obviously unsuccessful one. Wickham only marries Lydia to pay off his debts, and Lydia only marries Wickham just because she can and wants to be better than her sisters. Wickham and Lydia marry for reasons other than each other. Perhaps the most surprising unsuccessful marriage is between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. Their marriage is unsuccessful because it can be construed that Mr. Bennet does not care much for his family. He has five daughters and no son, so he has lost interest in raising his children. He also married Mrs. Bennet not for her intellectuality, but solely for looks. In the end, their marriage does not work because they marry for transient reasons like physical looks, but nothing permanent like intellectuality or personality.
									</p>
									<p class="text-indent">
										In conclusion, Jane Austen notes that true love and a successful marriage comes from loving each other for permanent characteristics, not for transient things like looks or money.

										Living in the Georgian and Regency Era as a woman was a difficult endeavor. The biggest problems for women at the time stemmed from the false idea that women and men were not equals, emotionally and intellectually. Because of this way of thought, women were preyed upon and looked at as property instead of equals. In most cases, a woman was not even equal in a court of law. This resulted in a multitude of problems regarding women's rights. Barely given a breath of expository, the first problem is thrust upon the reader in the very first few chapters. Mrs. Bennet wants Mr. Bennet to visit Mr. Bingley so he can be potentially married to one of her daughters. She wants this for many reasons, but mainly for their daughters well beings in the future. Society at that point did not believe that a woman could handle her own fortune, whether it be because they were believed to intellectually inferior, or far too emotional to handle it. The Bennet daughters would have to transfer their father's fortune to their husband who would maintain it for them. If they were not married, it would go to the next male relative in the family. Mrs. Bennet wants her daughters married off not just for money, but because she cares for their well beings and futures. This, however, shows another deeper problem. Mrs. Bennet wants to essentially sell off her daughters, encouraging them to marry just for monetary well being, not emotional well being. She cares little if her daughter's are married off without true love, mainly because she does not see the importance of it. Mr. Bennet married her long ago for looks, and she married him for money and social standing. She assumes that all, if not most marriages, should function the same way and wants for her daughters what she received. She does not necessarily want ill upon them, she just does not know anything better. In the end, it is because women are treated as inferior objects of possession that society poses a threat to Elizabeth.
									</p>
									<p class="text-indent">
										Having established exactly what is wrong with Austen's society for women, we can pinpoint what might lead Elizabeth to lead an unfulfilled life. To start, she must be married. This is not necessarily a bad thing, she might fall in love and marry. But in order to sustain the same social status, she must marry someone rich and in her social class or one above. This often does not happen, and a woman might fall in love with someone of the wrong class. They may be in love and extremely happy with each other, but society will shun them and cast them away. This might even include family turning away and cutting all contact with the new couple. In conclusion, if Elizabeth were to marry for true love instead of society, she may become an outcast, and if she were to strictly adhere to society's rules, she may marry for all the wrong reasons and end up as a Mrs. Hurst, forever overlooked.

										Jane Austen seeks to make reader’s enjoy her novels in many ways. She writes subtle satire as a way to provoke a sense of humorous absurdity that a reader can sit back and chuckle, “Wow, how ridiculous!” Perhaps the most obvious way she gets her satire across is through hyperbole, sarcasm, and irony. Her characters often engage in arguments or discussions thick with irony and hyperbole, for example, when Mrs. Bennet is considering Mr. Darcy, she does not care much for him until it is mentioned that he has twice as much money than Mr. Bingley. At that point, she says he has become very handsome. It is a fact that a person can be judged on his or her financial standing, but it becomes outright ridiculous when it begins to alter the physical perceptions of a person's features. The best example of her cutting sarcasm is through Mr. Bennet, the aloof and unconcerned father of the family. He often goes about his own business alone and disconnected, simply because he does not feel like he needs to be invested into his family due to the fact he has no son. Since he has no sons, he has given up on raising his children. Whenever he is bothered by the family, he either yields instantly to a request, or cuts them off with bitter sarcasm only to seclude himself into his study again. An example of his sarcasm comes very early in the novel. When Mrs. Bennet requests over and over that Mr. Bennet go to visit Mr. Bingley, he does not let them know that he already has until the very end. Essentially he plays dumb just to anger and frustrate his wife and children. A slightly darker note of irony is shown when Lydia is with Wickham, astonished that she was able to allure Wickham when her sisters or other girls were unable to. The irony here is that Wickham was and has allured many, many girls before her and, in truth, Lydia was nothing special.
									</p>
									<p class="text-indent">
										The sources of her humor come from her slight frustration with society. She does not completely rebel against society and rather enjoys it, but when she has qualms with certain aspects or points in society, those show as her attempts at humor. Mr. Bennet's sarcasm might stem from dislike that gender plays such an important role in how a person is valued. Mrs. Bennet's notes about Darcy probably stem from a dislike of how important money determined a person's value in her society, as well. After everything, though, Austen's humor is a light prodding of her society's values. She points out its flaws in humorous ways and gets the reader to look at them and instead of becoming angry, just laugh off how ridiculous people can be at times.
