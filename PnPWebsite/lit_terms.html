						<p><mark>verbal irony</mark> – at its root, irony means "saying one thing, but meaning another."<br/> Chapter 1: Mr. Bennet says, "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends." It seems like he means that he cares for his wife, but really he means that he just has to have dealt with her "nerves" for a long time.</p>
						<p><mark>dramatic irony</mark> – often called the most important irony in literature, it is when a reader knows of circumstances that characters do not.<br/>Chapter 50: Elizabeth thinks that Darcy would shun her family for her sister's inappropriate marriage, but really he was the one that fixed the situation for her.</p>
						<p><mark>situational irony</mark> - this happens when events occur that seem oddly too appropriate for the situation.<br/>Chapter :</p>
						<p><mark>sarcasm</mark> - is when the expression of the words conveyed differ from their true nature.<br/>See "verbal irony" for an example.</p>
						<p><mark>understatement</mark> - the opposite of exaggeration, where an event or occurence is under-defined to emphasize its meaning<br/>Chapter :</p>
						<p><mark>hyperbole</mark> - exaggeration or overstatement<br/>Chapter 1: "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them." Mrs. Bennet makes a joke saying that if dozens of people come to meet their daughters, Mr. Bennet would not even meet one of them.</p>
						<p><mark>satire</mark> - an attack of a particularly annoying or stupid characterisitc with burning sarcasm<br/>Chapter 3: Mr.Darcy looked very pleasing to Mrs. Bennet just because of his money, until she finds out his personality.</p>
						<p><mark>Horation satire</mark> - satire that focuses on light laughter and playful ridicule in a good humored and sympathetic way<br/>Chapter 4: Elizabeth says to Jane, "Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life." She is making fun of Jane's naivity, but in a light hearted way to tell Jane that its not too bad.</p>
						<p><mark>bathos</mark> - a point in literature where the author tries too hard and becomes trivial<br/></p>
