							<p><mark>verbal irony</mark> – at its root, irony means "saying one thing, but meaning another."<br/> Chapter 1: Mr. Bennet says, "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends." It seems like he means that he cares for his wife, but really he means that he just has to have dealt with her "nerves" for a long time.</p>
							<p><mark>dramatic irony</mark> – often called the most important irony in literature, it is when a reader knows of circumstances that characters do not.<br/>Chapter 50: Elizabeth thinks that Darcy would shun her family for her sister's inappropriate marriage, but really he was the one that fixed the situation for her.</p>
							<p><mark>situational irony</mark> - this happens when events occur that seem oddly too appropriate for the situation.<br/>Chapter :</p>
							<p><mark>sarcasm</mark> - is when the expression of the words conveyed differ from their true nature.<br/>See "verbal irony" for an example.</p>
							<p><mark>understatement</mark> - the opposite of exaggeration, where an event or occurrence is under-defined to emphasize its meaning<br/>Chapter :</p>
							<p><mark>hyperbole</mark> - exaggeration or overstatement<br/>Chapter 1: "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them." Mrs. Bennet makes a joke saying that if dozens of people come to meet their daughters, Mr. Bennet would not even meet one of them.</p>
							<p><mark>satire</mark> - an attack of a particularly annoying or stupid characteristic with burning sarcasm<br/>Chapter 3: Mr.Darcy looked very pleasing to Mrs. Bennet just because of his money, until she finds out his personality.</p>
							<p><mark>Horation satire</mark> - satire that focuses on light laughter and playful ridicule in a good humored and sympathetic way<br/>Chapter 4: Elizabeth says to Jane, "Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life." She is making fun of Jane's naivety, but in a light hearted way to tell Jane that its not too bad.</p>
							<p><mark>bathos</mark> - a point in literature where the author tries too hard and becomes trivial<br/></p>
							<p><mark>parody</mark> - an imitation of a serious manner created to ridicule the work it is imitating<br/></p>
							<p><mark>circumlocution</mark> - trivial and unclear speech or writing<br/></p>
							<p><mark>caricature</mark> - writing where specific aspects of a subject are especially exaggerated to ridicule that point<br/>Throughout the novel, Mr. Collins is stressed to be extremely socially awkward, time and time again.</p>
							<p><mark>center (or stream) of consciousness</mark> - a method of narration that describes in words the direct thoughts of the characters<br/></p>
							<p><mark>subjective narrator</mark> - literature where the narrator has an opinion or viewpoint and is invested within the story<br/></p>
							<p><mark>authorial intrusion</mark> - when the author steps away from the story to speak to the reader<br/></p>
							<p><mark>theme</mark> - a central idea that encompasses an entire literary work<br/>The main theme in Pride and Prejudice is "romantic satire" where Austen writes about romance in her time all the while poking at its flaws.</p>
							<p><mark>motif</mark> - a conspicuous returning element<br/>The "bad guy, but it turns out he's actually the good guy" motif is in Pride and Prejudice in the form of Darcy.</p>
							<p><mark>aphorism</mark> - a statement of truth or opinion expressed in a concise and witty manner<br/></p>
							<p><mark>epistolary novel</mark> - a method that authors use to convey a story through a series of letters<br/>Pride and Prejudice often uses letters to and from Elizabeth to convey events occurring out of her grasp or the ideas of other characters.</p>
							<p><mark>neoclassicism</mark> - the movement towards classical elements like design and architecture during the Restoration and the Enlightenment<br/></p>
							<p><mark>romanticism</mark> - an artistic philosophy prevalent during the nineteenth century that stressed that logic and reason were unimportant and reliance should be placed on emotions<br/></p>
							<p><mark>three volume novel</mark> - a Victorian style of writing novels made famous by Charles Edward Mudie, who essentially invented best seller lists by tactically selling these novels instead of single volume novels<br/>These kind of novels show up a lot in Pride and Prejudice, and people of the leisure class are judged based on the material they read. So if they did not read three volume novels they were considered to be reading trashy material. Pride and Prejudice was actually a three volume novel itself.</p>
							<p><mark>novel of manners</mark> - a novel that describes behaviors of specific social spheres in a specific era<br/>In a way, Pride and Prejudice is a satirical novel of manners for the Georgian era. It detailed what was socially acceptable, and what was not.</p>
							<p><mark>tone</mark> - using language, in this case literature, to convey an attitude or mood<br/></p>
							<p><mark>metonymy</mark> - representing an idea with a physical object<br/>Chapter 7: "I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart;" Mrs. Bennet acknowledges her daughter's desires to meet with a red coat, meaning her desire to meet an officer of the army who were known to wear red coats.</p>
							<p><mark>euphemism</mark> - using a mild or gentle phrase instead of a blunt, embarrassing, or painful one.<br/>Chapter 18: "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit." Mr. Bennet tells Mary to stop playing the piano, saying that she needs to give other girls when he really knows that she is playing poorly and does not want her to further embarrass herself</p>
							<p><mark>didactic literature</mark> - preachy writing that overdoes the effort of convincing the reader<br/>Chapter 10: "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?" In this quote, Mr. Darcy is using really fluffed up English prose in his letters, as he tries too hard to just use words with more than four syllables instead of words the simply roll off the tongue.</p>
							<p><mark>pedantic</mark> - overly scholarly, as if it came straight from a dictionary or classic novel<br/>See the example for "didactic literature." In that same quote, Mr. Darcy sounds like a dictionary in his writing.</p>
							<p><mark>sentimental</mark> - a type of novel that focuses on invoking emotions from readers<br/></p>
							<p><mark>coquettish</mark> - flirtatious<br/>Kitty and Lydia are often coquettish with officers of the army, proven when Lydia runs off with Wickham.</p>
							<p><mark>allusion</mark> - casual references<br/>A common allusion is Mr. Collins reference to Lady Catherine de Bourgh nearly every time he speaks.</p>
							<p><mark>anaphora</mark> - repeating the beginnings of sentences to create emphasis<br/></p>
							<p><mark>balanced clauses</mark> - clauses parallel each other by having similar structure, meaning, or length<br/></p>
