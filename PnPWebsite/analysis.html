									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is saying that people seek to be financially stable before they decide to look for marriage. However, she is satirizing the fact that people often use financial stability to assert themselves as worthy partners, and that it represents a person as much as their other characteristics, like intelligence or personality. She is also mentioning the fact that her society viewed women as property, instead of individuals, saying that man wants a wife as an object.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Again, Austen is referencing the need to be rich in order to appeal to other people in the leisure class. She is satirizing her society be showing that Mrs. Bennet cares little about anything else about the man, only that he is single and rich. She also shows the objectification of women again, only concerned about marrying off her daughters to the nearest rich man.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Not satire of Austen's society, but a very funny quote nonetheless. Mr. Bennet tells Mrs. Bennet that he is old friends with her nerves, not meaning he is actually friends with her nerves. He says "old" meaning he has had to deal with her "nerves," meaning nagging, for a long, long time.</td> 
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet might have said this in reference to Mr. Bennet "not" meeting Mr. Bingley, or it could be a poke at Austen's society. In Austen's era, women were not allowed to meet men themselves. They had to meet them through a close male friend or relative. In this way, it could be satire.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">After Mrs. Bennet nags and nags about how Mr. Bennet should visit Mr. Bingley, he actually does but does not tell her. She continues to nag until she says she does not want to see Mr. Bingley anymore. It is at this point that Mr. Bennet tells her that he did visit Mr. Bingley showing just how sarcastic Mr. Bennet can be.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet is saying that all she wants is her daughters happily married, especially to Mr. Bingley. It shows also shows that she wants the best for her daughters. To her, it is very important that they are married off because she and Mr. Bennet do not have a male heir, so when Mr. Bennet dies none of the daughters gets the family fortune.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote shows more about Austen's societal standards for women. Instead of being bold and blunt, people had to follow manners and customs to show affection with each other without being labeled as promiscuous. In this specific case, since Mr. Bingley singled out Jane to dance with twice, then he "favors" her, or likes her.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bennet jokes in a desperate manner saying that he wished that Mr. Bingley sprained his ankle so he would not have been able to dance at the ball. He does not mean this maliciously, but he says this because if Mr. Bingley had not danced, then Mrs. Bennet would not be able to bug Mr. Bennet with all of the details of the party.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never... Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Elizabeth is talking to Jane about Jane's personality. It seems that Elizabeth is being harsh, but really she is just playfully teasing her sister. Elizabeth says that Jane is very naive and sometimes too nice. She does not see the wrong in a lot of people so she has "liked many a stupider person," meaning a person who does not deserve her favor.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">The "him" in the quote is Mr. Bingley, as it outlines his close friendship with Mr. Darcy. This quote to repeat readers is very ironic, as Mr. Darcy has a very amiable personality once one is able to get past his defenses.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is again referencing her society's values, this time especially noting the distinction between social strata. Sir Lucas made a lot of money when he was a businessman, but when he was given a title, he wanted to be part of the leisure class. As the leisure class, he was supposed to be unemployed and earn money by investment. Any sign of work meant he was part of the "working class" and not the rich and powerful leisure class that had all the time in the world. Despite him earning a lot of money and having a title, he sold his businesses to be a true "leisure class" member and not be looked down upon by his peers. Austen makes a deep jab at her society with Sir Lucas as well. He was a businessman, and the important characters in the story that are from the working class are nice people, including Sir Lucas. The prime example is Mr. Gardiner, Elizabeth's uncle from her mother's side. This consistency in personality and business class might mean that Austen really respected the working class and often found them amiable compared to members of the leisure class.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This time Austen is scrutinizing societal standards again, believing that Mr. Darcy was rude to Mrs. Long because she did not own her own carriage and had to rent one. This shows strict societal standards that perhaps Austen is tired of.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is further defining Mrs. Bennet's characteristics as being a stubborn woman. Mr. Lucas playfully says that he would drink every day, and Mrs. Bennet says she would stop him, over and over until they finally leave the party.</td>
