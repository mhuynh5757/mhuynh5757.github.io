										<td class="text-indent">"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is saying that people seek to be financially stable before they decide to look for marriage. However, she is satirizing the fact that people often use financial stability to assert themselves as worthy partners, and that it represents a person as much as their other characteristics, like intelligence or personality. She is also mentioning the fact that her society viewed women as property, instead of individuals, saying that man wants a wife as an object.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Again, Austen is referencing the need to be rich in order to appeal to other people in the leisure class. She is satirizing her society be showing that Mrs. Bennet cares little about anything else about the man, only that he is single and rich. She also shows the objectification of women again, only concerned about marrying off her daughters to the nearest rich man.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Not satire of Austen's society, but a very funny quote nonetheless. Mr. Bennet tells Mrs. Bennet that he is old friends with her nerves, not meaning he is actually friends with her nerves. He says "old" meaning he has had to deal with her "nerves," meaning nagging, for a long, long time.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</td>
