										<td class="text-indent">"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is saying that people seek to be financially stable before they decide to look for marriage. However, she is satirizing the fact that people often use financial stability to assert themselves as worthy partners, and that it represents a person as much as their other characteristics, like intelligence or personality. She is also mentioning the fact that her society viewed women as property, instead of individuals, saying that man wants a wife as an object.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Again, Austen is referencing the need to be rich in order to appeal to other people in the leisure class. She is satirizing her society be showing that Mrs. Bennet cares little about anything else about the man, only that he is single and rich. She also shows the objectification of women again, only concerned about marrying off her daughters to the nearest rich man.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bennet tells Mrs. Bennet that he is old friends with her nerves, not meaning he is actually friends with her nerves. He says "old" meaning he has had to deal with her "nerves," meaning nagging, for a long, long time. Austen is also satirizing marriage in general, making a point that a father can be so disconnected from his family and wife and still be considered in his time a good father, just because he has the money.</td> 
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet might have said this in reference to Mr. Bennet "not" meeting Mr. Bingley, or it could be a poke at Austen's society. In Austen's era, women were not allowed to meet men themselves. They had to meet them through a close male friend or relative. In this way, it could be satire.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">After Mrs. Bennet nags and nags about how Mr. Bennet should visit Mr. Bingley, he actually does but does not tell her. She continues to nag until she says she does not want to see Mr. Bingley anymore. It is at this point that Mr. Bennet tells her that he did visit Mr. Bingley showing just how sarcastic Mr. Bennet can be.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet is saying that all she wants is her daughters happily married, especially to Mr. Bingley. It shows also shows that she wants the best for her daughters. To her, it is very important that they are married off because she and Mr. Bennet do not have a male heir, so when Mr. Bennet dies none of the daughters gets the family fortune.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote shows more about Austen's societal standards for women. Instead of being bold and blunt, people had to follow manners and customs to show affection with each other without being labeled as promiscuous. In this specific case, since Mr. Bingley singled out Jane to dance with twice, then he "favors" her, or likes her.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bennet jokes in a desperate manner saying that he wished that Mr. Bingley sprained his ankle so he would not have been able to dance at the ball. He does not mean this maliciously, but he says this because if Mr. Bingley had not danced, then Mrs. Bennet would not be able to bug Mr. Bennet with all of the details of the party.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never... Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Elizabeth is talking to Jane about Jane's personality. It seems that Elizabeth is being harsh, but really she is just playfully teasing her sister. Elizabeth says that Jane is very naive and sometimes too nice. She does not see the wrong in a lot of people so she has "liked many a stupider person," meaning a person who does not deserve her favor.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">The "him" in the quote is Mr. Bingley, as it outlines his close friendship with Mr. Darcy. This quote to repeat readers is very ironic, as Mr. Darcy has a very amiable personality once one is able to get past his defenses.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is again referencing her society's values, this time especially noting the distinction between social strata. Sir Lucas made a lot of money when he was a businessman, but when he was given a title, he wanted to be part of the leisure class. As the leisure class, he was supposed to be unemployed and earn money by investment. Any sign of work meant he was part of the "working class" and not the rich and powerful leisure class that had all the time in the world. Despite him earning a lot of money and having a title, he sold his businesses to be a true "leisure class" member and not be looked down upon by his peers. Austen makes a deep jab at her society with Sir Lucas as well. He was a businessman, and the important characters in the story that are from the working class are nice people, including Sir Lucas. The prime example is Mr. Gardiner, Elizabeth's uncle from her mother's side. This consistency in personality and business class might mean that Austen really respected the working class and often found them amiable compared to members of the leisure class.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This time Austen is scrutinizing societal standards again, believing that Mr. Darcy was rude to Mrs. Long because she did not own her own carriage and had to rent one. This shows strict societal standards that perhaps Austen is tired of.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is further defining Mrs. Bennet's characteristics as being a stubborn woman. Mr. Lucas playfully says that he would drink every day, and Mrs. Bennet says she would stop him, over and over until they finally leave the party.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out."</td>
										<td class="text-center">6</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote shows again the arduous steps men and women had to go through to converse their feelings to each other. If they were blunt, they would risk being labeled as too flirtatious. Instead, women had to "act natural" instead of tell the person she was going after that she was interested. Also, the man would have to be the one to ask her, society would not allow it the other way around.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</td>
										<td class="text-center">6</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Sir Lucas, during a short conversation with Mr. Darcy, is asking why Elizabeth is not dancing. He then offers that Elizabeth might dance with Mr. Darcy but she refuses. In Austen's time, if a woman were to refuse dancing with a man, she was to not dance for the rest of the night so it was not implied that she was put off by the man she rejected. This quote has much more meaning than just one rejection, because it meant that Elizabeth ruined her entire night just so she did not dance with Mr. Darcy.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."</td>
										<td class="text-center">7</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Jane receives a letter from Mr. Bingley offering her dinner at his temporary estate at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet decides to send Jane on horseback because it would be raining that night so Jane could not ride home. Jane would be forced to stay the night at Netherfield, and in Austen's time, if a single woman was to stay at a single man's estate alone, then it was assumed that they favored each other.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.</td>
										<td class="text-center">7</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In order to care for her sick sister, Elizabeth walked from her home to Netherfield to tend to Jane. Instead of taking horses, she walked through 3 miles of mud, as England is very damp and it had just rained the night before. By the time Elizabeth got the Netherfield, she was probably caked shin high with mud. She was expecting be looked upon with disdain and did so just to irk the Bingleys and Darcy, but instead she was taken in with warm and kind welcome. She assumed that they would think her too poor to even hire a carriage, let alone own one, to get her to Netherfield.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."<br/>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."<br/>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.<br/>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."<br/>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.</td>
										<td class="text-center">8</td>
										<td class="text-indent">The Bingley sisters are laughing about how the Bennets are related to the "working class." Austen is again satirizing her society, because in her time, if a person was related to the working class, then their title as part of the leisure class was soiled. They were considered to be impure and partially working class themselves. The Bingley sisters are saying this to tease Mr. Bingley who is obviously attracted to Jane, but Darcy reminds Mr. Bingley of the stigma of the "working class" making the "leisure class" impure to try and dissuade Mr. Bingley from seeking further attention from Jane.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."</td>
										<td class="text-center">8</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mr. Darcy is detailing the qualities that make a successful and attractive woman. He is making obvious hints towards liking Elizabeth, as it was joked that she loved to read and read very well, and here he is saying that reading is very important trait to him.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."<br/>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."</td>
										<td class="text-center">9</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mrs. Bennet is talking about how lovely the countryside is compared to the city and how Mr. Darcy is wrong to judge the country harsher than the city, as it seems like Mr. Darcy does not want to be in the country at all. She says that she dines with twenty four different families in the countryside, but that number is shadowed by the enormous amount of different people in the city. This makes the Bingley sisters and Darcy laugh, as it is obvious Mrs. Bennet does not know what she is talking about.</td>

										<td class="text-center">9</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth is talking about how Charlotte Lucas had a man who had favored her very much, but surprisingly did not offer her engagement. Elizabeth then jokes that it was probably because of his poetry, stating that if poetry was written just to attract a woman instead of being heartfelt, then it is hindering to the cause instead of assisting.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"</td>
										<td class="text-center">10</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bingley is teasing his friend, Mr. Darcy, saying that his writing is far too wordy to be considered easy to write or read. Mr. Bingley is saying that most of Mr. Darcy's letters are circumlocution and pedantic.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said: "Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude." Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up.</td>
										<td class="text-center">11</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Miss Bingley wants to catch Mr. Darcy's attention by walking around him and trying to "strut her stuff." He does not really care much for her, so he does not even look up from what he is doing. Knowing that Mr. Darcy finds Elizabeth attractive, she asks Elizabeth to get up and walk with her, encouraging her to do so because it would soothe their muscles from sitting for so long in one place. Miss Bingley succeeds, and Mr. Darcy finally looks up to watch Elizabeth walk. Despite Elizabeth knowing exactly what Mrs. Bingley was doing, she got up to walk anyway, either to bug or actually show off her figure to Mr. Darcy.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.</td>
										<td class="text-center">12</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth is trying to get her mother to send a carriage to her so she and Jane can leave Netherfield and stop pestering imposing and their good will. People began to say that it was OK to stay another day, as a sign of common courtesy, but Miss Bingley did not actually want them to stay another day. She just wanted to look polite, but resented Elizabeth for taking Mr. Darcy's attention away from herself. This is another poke that Austen makes at society, where Miss Bingley offers to be nice but does actually want to be nice, hoping Elizabeth would refuse the offer.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."</td>
										<td class="text-center">13</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is again defining her absurd social standards and mannerisms. Since Mr. Bennet does not have a direct male heir, that being a son, his estate would be handed off to the closed male relative. The person that would earn the inheritance was Mr. Collins, Mr. Bennet's cousin. Despite Mr. Bennet having had a falling out with Mr. Collins father, he is forced to give his estate to him after death unless one of his daughters has a husband. This shows the point Austen is trying to make: the law would rather give Mr. Bennet's inheritance to someone who hates him, instead of a woman.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them.</td>
										<td class="text-center">14</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Collins is talking about his patroness, Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Lady Catherine has a daughter who she claims that in "true beauty" surpasses every other woman, but in reality, her daughter is sick all the time and, as a result, unattractive. No one argues with Lady Catherine because she is simply too rich and powerful to disagree with and still keep a reputation, because with that kind of money and power, words and rumor carry a lot of weight. It is also humorous as Mr. Collins says that she has a private mentor as she cannot learn normally because she is sick so often, but says she would have "no doubt" succeeded anyways, showing how much of a "yes"-man Mr. Collins is and how little of his own opinion he has.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.</td>
										<td class="text-center">15</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is satirizing "true love" again as Mr. Collins believes himself to be in love with Jane, until Mrs. Bennet says that she might be engaged soon to Mr. Bingley. She suggests that Mr. Collins choose Elizabeth and his "true love" changes in that same instant from Jane to Elizabeth. Austen is making the point that often times "true love" is shallow and in reality just temporary affection.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.</td>
										<td class="text-center">16</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth goes to a party at the Phillip's house in Meryton with her sisters and Mr. Collins, and there she meets Mr. Wickham. At the party, his beauty catches the attention of all the women, but he decides to sit down and talk with Elizabeth. Because he was very good at speaking and looked good to boot, she thought that no matter what he said, she would enjoy the conversation. Austen is making a poke at puppy love here, showing that a little charisma and good looks can make you appeal, even if you were ranting on and on. This is juxtaposition with Mr. Collins as well, as he rants on and on but does not have the social skill or physical attraction to keep people glued to his words.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."</td>
										<td class="text-center">16</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Later on in the story, we learn that Mr. Darcy is not as proud as the mask that puts on and is very generous. He does so out of the good of his heart, but Wickham twists that and says that everything he does is part of his pride. Austen makes this point to show how people of her time would do things not because it was good to do, but because it made them famous. They donated not to help the poor, but to tell everyone else how much they could donate to the poor.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks."</td>
										<td class="text-center">17</td>
										<td class="text-indent">We learn later on that everything Wickham has said is a complete lie. However, at the time Elizabeth naively believes him because she feels slight affection for his charisma and looks. Austen writes this satirizing childish love again, showing how rash affection like Elizabeth's for Wickham clouds thought processes and leads to hasty decisions.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy."</td>
										<td class="text-center">18</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Again Elizabeth is falling prey to thoughts clouded by emotions. She likes Wickham and dislikes Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley, so when they try to tell her the truth, she automatically assumes that they are lying. They look worse in her eyes and Wickham looks more and more attractive because she already likes him and now the enemy of her enemy is her friend. This is again Austen poking at love clouding the ability to decipher lies and deceit.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.</td>
										<td class="text-center">18</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mrs. Bennet is reflecting upon the events that are occurring with her daughters. She is happy about Jane being married to Mr. Bingley as he was rich and amiable, and she was happy that Mr. Collins was to be married to Elizabeth so that the estate was safe. She does not mind that Mr. Collins is not the most amiable person because she likes Elizabeth the least of all her children for some reason. This is another poke that Austen makes, showing how girls in the family were treated as objects, only to be used as anchors to attach one fortune to another.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."</td>
										<td class="text-center">19</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is satirizing the details of marriage with this quote. In her era, marriages were often made to secure financial stability, so when Mr. Collins offers engagement to Elizabeth, he had no idea in his mind that he might have been rejected. Despite Elizabeth bluntly saying no, he assumes that she is just playing hard to get because she needs his financial stability.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."</td>
										<td class="text-center">20</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mrs. Bennet is furious that Elizabeth did not take Mr. Collins hand in marriage. Mrs. Bennet threatens that he will never talk to Elizabeth again if she does not marry him, but it does not work and she directs Mr. Bennet to yell at Elizabeth for her. Mr. Bennet says that he will never talk to Elizabeth again if she does marry Mr. Collins, essentially nullifying any threats from Mrs. Bennet. At first, it seems that Mr. Bennet just wants Elizabeth to do whatever makes her happy, but really Austen is just showing an imperfect marriage and how it affects people, because Mr. Bennet does not want to deal with his family at all so he takes the easy way out and lets them fight amongst themselves instead of making a decision.</td>
									</tr>

										<td class="text-indent">"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."</td>
										<td class="text-center">21</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is defining mannerisms of her era, as it was improper in her time for a single man to send a single woman a private letter. The letter was sent to Jane by Miss Bingley instead of Mr. Bingley for this reason.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!" The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: "Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"</td>
										<td class="text-center">22</td>
										<td class="text-indent">After being rejected by Elizabeth, Mr. Collins moves on with his search for a wife. Charlotte Lucas, daughter of Lord and Lady Lucas, meets him and the two engage. This is much to Elizabeth's shock, but the marriage works for many reasons. Like many marriages in Austen's era, Charlotte's marriage was mostly business. She was much older than Elizabeth and on the verge of being considered an old maid, so she was desperate to get married before it was too late. She was not looking for love, as she preferred to be alone so she did not care much if she did not truly love her husband, and it was her goal to get a husband with his own house so she could live somewhere of her own. It is beneficial to Mr. Collins as well because he only needed a wife to complete his ordain ship under Lady Catherine de Bourgh.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?" Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.</td>
										<td class="text-center">23</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is showing how Lydia is not the most polite girl, as well as defining another manner that her society imposed. Her society, like most societies, request that a person not be interrupted, especially when telling people that their child just got engaged. Austen is also making another praise towards the working class, as Lord Lucas was raised as part of the working class and made himself on his hard work. Because he was part of the working class he was raised well and was very nice through the interruption.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then."</td>
										<td class="text-center">24</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote is said by Mr. Bennet, who is talking about Jane and her short time with Mr. Bingley. In it, Austen is again making a point against her society's values. Her society states that a woman was to be passive, stay at home mother at a certain age, but before then be a normal teenage girl falling in puppy love once in a while.</td>

									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"...The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get..."</td>
										<td class="text-center">25</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mrs. Bennet is talking to her sister, Mrs. Gardiner, about Mr. Bingley's rejection of Jane and Elizabeth's rejection of Mr. Collins. She knows that Charlotte Lucas was almost old enough to be un-marriageable and knows that Charlotte married out of business interests. To Mrs. Bennet, there is no such thing as "true love" and all relationships should be sought out for financial efforts. Mrs. Bennet not only refers to Charlotte's marriage, but also how Lord Lucas took the opportunity to reference the King in his speech while being inducted as mayor in order to get knighted as "lord" and bring his social class up.</td>

									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."</td>
										<td class="text-center">26</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Gardiner is worried Elizabeth might be "falling in love" with Mr. Wickham for all the wrong reasons, so she seeks to tell Elizabeth to be careful with who she loves. Elizabeth is much smarter than that, but the real foreshadowing becomes apparent later in the story when Lydia runs off with Mr. Wickham to elope, only because she "was able to do what none of her sisters could." The quote also has irony, in which she says "if he had the fortune he ought to have" because he was not given any inheritance at all.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</td>
										<td class="text-center">27</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is making fun of Mr. Bennet's disconnect with his family again. Elizabeth is his favorite daughter, so even asking for a letter from his daughter is a huge request. Normally, he would just be happy that his family is out of his hair so he could do whatever he wanted. Austen jokes that he almost cares so much that he might even take the time out of his reading and leisure to respond.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."</td>
										<td class="text-center">28</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth sees Miss de Bourgh driving by the Collins' house in her carriage on the way to Rosings Park and notes her sickly as well as cross looks. Basically, she is saying that Miss de Bourgh looks ugly and mean, and since she knows that she was destined to marry mean Mr. Darcy, then they would make a perfect couple.</td>

									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."</td>
										<td class="text-center">29</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote is from Mr. Collins, talking to Elizabeth on their way to Elizabeth's first visit into Rosings Park. Mr. Collins, hopefully in good spirits, tries to say Elizabeth looks fine the way she's dressed, but by saying that Elizabeth looks inelegant and and beneath Lady Catherine he sounds like a terribly rude man. This is also Austen's point about social class being defined by something as simple as clothing, the more "elegant" the higher the class. Based on your clothes, people of the same rank could even look down upon you.</td>

									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.</td>
										<td class="text-center">29</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Lady Catherine is expressing her disbelief that someone dare not answer her question with respect and directness. She asked Elizabeth how old she was, and Elizabeth only responded saying that she was old enough to have three younger sisters that were all grown up. Austen shows here that in her society, the rich and powerful get exactly what they want, when they want, and if they got anything else they were deeply offended that someone dare talk down to them.</td>

										<td class="text-indent">"...but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement."</td>
										<td class="text-center">30</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth is the Collins' house with Charlotte and the two spend much of their time together. Elizabeth wonders why they do not use the larger dining room for reading or talking, but she then realizes that it is because Mr. Collins frequents that area and the room that they normally used was out of the way, where Mr. Collins rarely came. Elizabeth realizes that Charlotte specifically chose this room so she would not have to deal with Mr. Collins often, as she either liked solitude or simply did not want to talk to Mr. Collins. This is Austen's re-reference to the business-like manner of the couple's marriage, as it made in the interest of securing them as husband and wife, not lovers.</td>
