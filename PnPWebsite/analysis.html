									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is saying that people seek to be financially stable before they decide to look for marriage. However, she is satirizing the fact that people often use financial stability to assert themselves as worthy partners, and that it represents a person as much as their other characteristics, like intelligence or personality. She is also mentioning the fact that her society viewed women as property, instead of individuals, saying that man wants a wife as an object.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Again, Austen is referencing the need to be rich in order to appeal to other people in the leisure class. She is satirizing her society be showing that Mrs. Bennet cares little about anything else about the man, only that he is single and rich. She also shows the objectification of women again, only concerned about marrying off her daughters to the nearest rich man.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."</td>
										<td class="text-center">1</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bennet tells Mrs. Bennet that he is old friends with her nerves, not meaning he is actually friends with her nerves. He says "old" meaning he has had to deal with her "nerves," meaning nagging, for a long, long time. Austen is also satirizing marriage in general, making a point that a father can be so disconnected from his family and wife and still be considered in his time a good father, just because he has the money.</td> 
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet might have said this in reference to Mr. Bennet "not" meeting Mr. Bingley, or it could be a poke at Austen's society. In Austen's era, women were not allowed to meet men themselves. They had to meet them through a close male friend or relative. In this way, it could be satire.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."</td>
										<td class="text-center">2</td>
										<td class="text-indent">After Mrs. Bennet nags and nags about how Mr. Bennet should visit Mr. Bingley, he actually does but does not tell her. She continues to nag until she says she does not want to see Mr. Bingley anymore. It is at this point that Mr. Bennet tells her that he did visit Mr. Bingley showing just how sarcastic Mr. Bennet can be.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet is saying that all she wants is her daughters happily married, especially to Mr. Bingley. It shows also shows that she wants the best for her daughters. To her, it is very important that they are married off because she and Mr. Bennet do not have a male heir, so when Mr. Bennet dies none of the daughters gets the family fortune.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote shows more about Austen's societal standards for women. Instead of being bold and blunt, people had to follow manners and customs to show affection with each other without being labeled as promiscuous. In this specific case, since Mr. Bingley singled out Jane to dance with twice, then he "favors" her, or likes her.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"</td>
										<td class="text-center">3</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Bennet jokes in a desperate manner saying that he wished that Mr. Bingley sprained his ankle so he would not have been able to dance at the ball. He does not mean this maliciously, but he says this because if Mr. Bingley had not danced, then Mrs. Bennet would not be able to bug Mr. Bennet with all of the details of the party.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never... Well, he certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a stupider person."</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Elizabeth is talking to Jane about Jane's personality. It seems that Elizabeth is being harsh, but really she is just playfully teasing her sister. Elizabeth says that Jane is very naive and sometimes too nice. She does not see the wrong in a lot of people so she has "liked many a stupider person," meaning a person who does not deserve her favor.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character</td>
										<td class="text-center">4</td>
										<td class="text-indent">The "him" in the quote is Mr. Bingley, as it outlines his close friendship with Mr. Darcy. This quote to repeat readers is very ironic, as Mr. Darcy has a very amiable personality once one is able to get past his defenses.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him courteous.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is again referencing her society's values, this time especially noting the distinction between social strata. Sir Lucas made a lot of money when he was a businessman, but when he was given a title, he wanted to be part of the leisure class. As the leisure class, he was supposed to be unemployed and earn money by investment. Any sign of work meant he was part of the "working class" and not the rich and powerful leisure class that had all the time in the world. Despite him earning a lot of money and having a title, he sold his businesses to be a true "leisure class" member and not be looked down upon by his peers. Austen makes a deep jab at her society with Sir Lucas as well. He was a businessman, and the important characters in the story that are from the working class are nice people, including Sir Lucas. The prime example is Mr. Gardiner, Elizabeth's uncle from her mother's side. This consistency in personality and business class might mean that Austen really respected the working class and often found them amiable compared to members of the leisure class.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This time Austen is scrutinizing societal standards again, believing that Mr. Darcy was rude to Mrs. Long because she did not own her own carriage and had to rent one. This shows strict societal standards that perhaps Austen is tired of.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.</td>
										<td class="text-center">5</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Austen is further defining Mrs. Bennet's characteristics as being a stubborn woman. Mr. Lucas playfully says that he would drink every day, and Mrs. Bennet says she would stop him, over and over until they finally leave the party.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal it, he must find it out."</td>
										<td class="text-center">6</td>
										<td class="text-indent">This quote shows again the arduous steps men and women had to go through to converse their feelings to each other. If they were blunt, they would risk being labeled as too flirtatious. Instead, women had to "act natural" instead of tell the person she was going after that she was interested. Also, the man would have to be the one to ask her, society would not allow it the other way around.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.</td>
										<td class="text-center">6</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Sir Lucas, during a short conversation with Mr. Darcy, is asking why Elizabeth is not dancing. He then offers that Elizabeth might dance with Mr. Darcy but she refuses. In Austen's time, if a woman were to refuse dancing with a man, she was to not dance for the rest of the night so it was not implied that she was put off by the man she rejected. This quote has much more meaning than just one rejection, because it meant that Elizabeth ruined her entire night just so she did not dance with Mr. Darcy.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."</td>
										<td class="text-center">7</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Jane receives a letter from Mr. Bingley offering her dinner at his temporary estate at Netherfield. Mrs. Bennet decides to send Jane on horseback because it would be raining that night so Jane could not ride home. Jane would be forced to stay the night at Netherfield, and in Austen's time, if a single woman was to stay at a single man's estate alone, then it was assumed that they favored each other.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness.</td>
										<td class="text-center">7</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In order to care for her sick sister, Elizabeth walked from her home to Netherfield to tend to Jane. Instead of taking horses, she walked through 3 miles of mud, as England is very damp and it had just rained the night before. By the time Elizabeth got the Netherfield, she was probably caked shin high with mud. She was expecting be looked upon with disdain and did so just to irk the Bingleys and Darcy, but instead she was taken in with warm and kind welcome. She assumed that they would think her too poor to even hire a carriage, let alone own one, to get her to Netherfield.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."<br/>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."<br/>"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.<br/>"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."<br/>"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.</td>
										<td class="text-center">8</td>
										<td class="text-indent">The Bingley sisters are laughing about how the Bennets are related to the "working class." Austen is again satirizing her society, because in her time, if a person was related to the working class, then their title as part of the leisure class was soiled. They were considered to be impure and partially working class themselves. The Bingley sisters are saying this to tease Mr. Bingley who is obviously attracted to Jane, but Darcy reminds Mr. Bingley of the stigma of the "working class" making the "leisure class" impure to try and dissuade Mr. Bingley from seeking further attention from Jane.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."</td>
										<td class="text-center">8</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mr. Darcy is detailing the qualities that make a successful and attractive woman. He is making obvious hints towards liking Elizabeth, as it was joked that she loved to read and read very well, and here he is saying that reading is very important trait to him.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."<br/>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."</td>
										<td class="text-center">9</td>
										<td class="text-indent">In this quote, Mrs. Bennet is talking about how lovely the countryside is compared to the city and how Mr. Darcy is wrong to judge the country harsher than the city, as it seems like Mr. Darcy does not want to be in the country at all. She says that she dines with twenty four different families in the countryside, but that number is shadowed by the enormous amount of different people in the city. This makes the Bingley sisters and Darcy laugh, as it is obvious Mrs. Bennet does not know what she is talking about.</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td class="text-indent">"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."</td>
										<td class="text-center">9</td>
										<td class="text-indent">Elizabeth is talking about how Charlotte Lucas had a man who had favored her very much, but surprisingly did not offer her engagement. Elizabeth then jokes that it was probably because of his poetry, stating that if poetry was written just to attract a woman instead of being heartfelt, then it is hindering to the cause instead of assisting.</td>
